      ORNL developed software to support the research in electrochemical energy storage systems. The code is open source, available on <a href="https://github.com/ORNL-CEES/Cap">github</a>. It provides a straightforward API that aligns well with real-world electrochemical experiments and is designed to ease development and testing of numerical models for energy storage devices. In collaboration with UT Austin, ORNL examined the inadequacy of lower-fidelity equivalent circuit models for predicting the behavior of the supercapacitor double-layer. For that purpose, we investigated various techniques to characterize the electrochemical behavior of storage systems which lead us to perform full impedance spectroscopy analysis on our high-fidelity models (a unique capability!). Fig.&#x00A0;<a href="#x1-5001r8">8<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:bode_plot_high_fidelity_vs_equivalent_circuit --></a> plots the frequency response of the finite-element model next to a simple resistor-capacitor equivalent circuit, demonstrating that the equivalent circuit model is unable to capure the higher frequency behavior of supercapacitors. <a id="x1-5002r13"></a>
